A React application built with [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Features

1. Add Nodes by Drag and drop.
2. Connect nodes by clicking from one node's edge to another.
3. Clicking on a node selects it, and its label can be modified from the right sidebar.
4. Clicking anywhere on the pane deselects the selected node.
5. Save and restore functionality, which saves the current state of the nodes and their connections, and can restore the state later.
